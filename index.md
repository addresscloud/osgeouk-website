### FOSS4G:UK Local 2022

We ran [FOSS4G:UK 2022 Local](https://uk.osgeo.org/foss4guk2022local/) on *Thu 17 Nov 2022*. This was a hybrid conference, but with a twist: there was no central physical location. We had 9 venues geographically dispersed across the UK. 

For details, check out the [FOSS4G:UK 2022 Local](https://uk.osgeo.org/foss4guk2022local/) site.

[FOSS4GUK Online 2020](/foss4gukonline2020/) was a big success - for an outlay of around £200, we had:

* 600 delegates from 77 countries
* 33 presentations
* £2,500 raised for OSGeo and MapAction
* 270 subscribers to our YouTube channel

[FOSS4GUK 2019](/foss4guk2019/){:target="_newpage"} has been and gone, and was an enormously successful event. Our thanks go out to the organising committee, sponsors and delegates. Videos are available on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCg0wX857AHUGM3qCzR6PcwQ){:target="_newpage"}. Also see the twitter hashtags [#FOSS4GUK](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FOSS4GUK){:target="_newpage"} and [#FOSS4GUK2019](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23foss4guk2019){:target="_newpage"} for a sense of what it was like.
